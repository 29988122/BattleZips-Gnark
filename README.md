This fork of `zkbattleship-circuit` uses a zkSNARK arithmetic circuit implementation by [tommymsz006](https://github.com/tommymsz006/zkbattleship), a prototype [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) game built on zkSNARKs proof and verification. It is being updated for 2022 and work is in progress.
